### How do I log in to Cboard?

### How do I logout?

You can log out by clicking the settings icon, and the option will also appear in red. You can also double click the lock symbol on the right corner, and once you unlock the screen and the red bar appears, click on the icon to the left of the lock (your picture if you have one loaded) and the option to log out will appear in red. 

### What is the difference between a registered and a non-registered user?

A registered user is able to personalize their boards, and the changes made will be saved to their account so that when they log back in, they can use their customized boards. A non-registered user won't be able to save changes safely. We recommend registering just in case, so you can save all your changes safely!

### How do I update my user information?

To update your user information, follow the same steps you would if you were trying to log out. Double click the lock symbol on the right corner, and once you unlock the screen and the red bar appears, click on the icon to the left of the lock (your picture if you have one loaded), and you can then edit your user information.

### What devices and OS are supported?

Cboard works on modern browsers and is available on a wide variety of platforms, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

Cboard is a web based app so will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the

settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

Don’t forget you can also use browser magnification or zoom to a certain degree depending on the computer, tablet or phone screen size.

Please ask Cboard about using high contrast mode for those with visual impairment as browser based options are not helpful when using this type of web app.

### Which languages are supported by Cboard?

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

### Can Cboard read my message out aloud?

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box. You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud. If a personalised recording of a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice. This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child’s voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable. Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone.

### Speech capabilities

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into settings, and under the 'Language' category is the 'Speech' category. When you press 'Speech' you will be able to edit the pitch and pace of speech on Cboard.

### Can I change any navigation settings?

Use the Navigation section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the System Category in Settings allows you to have a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select. It is also possible to allow a delete (‘x’) button to appear above each symbol as they are presented within the

message box. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence.

### Navigation trough the interface 

In order to edit and facilitate navigating through Cboard, the Navigation button, the last within System (all in Settings) allows to add certain details to make using the board easier. The first option within Navigation allows a larger 'back' button that is easier to press because of the size. The second adds an 'x' button to make it easier to delete symbols, and the third makes it easier to unlock by requiring only one click to unlock settings.
