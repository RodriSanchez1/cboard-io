  Once you have verified your account you will have access to Cboard, and will receive another e-mail confirming you were successfully verified.
  
![Cboard signup](/images/help/signup.png "Cboard signup")

###   <a name='CanIregistermyselfusingmysocialmediaaccounts'></a>Can I register myself using my social media accounts?

Yes! On the log in page, you will be given the option to sign up with your Google or Facebook account if you wish to do so. You can also register with an e-mail address. 

###   <a name='HowdoIlogintoCboardonceIamaregistereduser'></a>How do I log in to Cboard once I am a registered user?

To log in to Cboard, you follow the first step used to sign up, but instead of clicking SIGN UP on the Welcome screen, click LOGIN. You will then be asked to provide the e-mail you initially signed up with, and the password you set up.

![Cboard login](/images/help/login.png "Cboard login")

###   <a name='HowdoIlogout'></a>How do I logout?

You can log out by clicking the settings icon, and the option will also appear in red. You can also double click the lock symbol on the right corner, and once you unlock the screen and the red bar appears, click on the icon to the left of the lock (your picture if you have one loaded) and the option to log out will appear in red. 

###   <a name='Whatisthedifferencebetweenaregisteredandanon-registereduser'></a>What is the difference between a registered and a non-registered user?

A registered user is able to personalize their boards, and the changes made will be saved to their account so that when they log back in, they can use their customized boards. A non-registered user won't be able to save changes safely. We recommend registering just in case, so your changes are guaranteed to be saved. 

###   <a name='HowdoIupdatemyuserinformation'></a>How do I update my user information?

To update your user information, follow the same steps you would use if you were trying to log out. Select the lock symbol on the top right corner of the board – three clicks or taps, and once you unlock the screen, select the icon to the left of the lock (user name initials), and you can then edit your user information.

###   <a name='HowdoIresetmypassword'></a>How do I reset my password?

In order to reset your password, please e-mail support@cboard.io and we will get back to you.

##   <a name='Features'></a>Features 

###   <a name='WhatdevicesandOSaresupported'></a>What devices and OS are supported?

Cboard works on modern browsers and is available on a wide variety of platforms, including desktops, tablets and mobile phones.

![Browser support](/images/help/browsers.png "Browser support")

Cboard is a web based app so will respond to the settings provided by the individual browsers. This may mean you have different results to the settings provided by Cboard. For example you may find different speech options being offered.

Don’t forget you can also use browser magnification or zoom to a certain degree depending on the computer, tablet or phone screen size.

Please ask Cboard about using high contrast mode for those with visual impairment as browser based options are not helpful when using this type of web app.

###   <a name='WhichlanguagesaresupportedbyCboard'></a>Which languages are supported by Cboard?

Cboard comes with support for 33 languages. To select a different language go to SETTINGS – select LANGUAGE and those available will appear. Make a choice and a ‘tick’ will appear beside the language.

###   <a name='CanCboardreadmymessageoutaloud'></a>Can Cboard read my message out aloud?

Yes, Cboard uses the synthetic speech output available on your device to read out individual labels found below each symbol as they are added to the message output box.  You can select a complete message and it will also be read aloud.  If a personalised recording of  a sound, word or phrase has been added to a symbol (instructions under Talking – Voice Recordings) you will hear that recording instead of the synthesised voice.  This can be very helpful where a translation is not available in a language, a child’s voice is needed or an accent is unacceptable.  Please ensure web access has been given to your microphone. 

###   <a name='Speechcapabilities'></a>Speech capabilities

In order to adjust speech capabilities, go into settings, and under the 'Language' category is the 'Speech' category. When you press 'Speech' you will be able to edit the pitch and pace of speech on Cboard.

###   <a name='CanIchangeanynavigationsettings'></a>Can I change any navigation settings?

Use the Navigation section to edit and facilitate the way you use to move around Cboard and delete symbols in the message box. Navigation at the end of the System Category in Settings allows you to have a larger ‘back’ button that is easier to select. It is also possible to allow a delete (‘x’) button to appear above each symbol as they are presented within the

message box. This can make it easier to delete symbols within a sentence.

###   <a name='Navigationthroughtheinterface'></a>Navigation through the interface 

In order to edit and facilitate navigating through Cboard, the Navigation button, the last within System (all in Settings) allows to add certain details to make using the board easier. The first option within Navigation allows a larger 'back' button that is easier to press because of the size. The second adds an 'x' button to make it easier to delete symbols, and the third makes it easier to unlock by requiring only one click to unlock settings.

##   <a name='BoardEditing'></a>Board Editing

###   <a name='HowdoIcreateanemptyboard'></a>How do I create an empty board?
In cboard an empty board is equivalent to a folder.

 If you want to create a new empty you just have to create a new folder, and that will create a new empty board in the cboard storage. the new empty board will be immediately available for edition and can be set as the root board (using the build button), which means that it will be the first board you see the next time you open cboard from scratch.

To create a new folder, begin by unlocking the screen pressing the lock button on the right hand side. Once you unlock the screen, press the plus symbol on the right hand side, in order to 'add tile'. You will then be given the option to add a tile, but instead of adding a button (the first and automatic option), press the 'folder' option directly below it. By creating a folder, you are creating a new board to which you can add more tiles and folders. You can choose to add a linked or empty board by selecting the small lock on the top right-hand side of the bar above the board, (below the arrow with a cross). Once you have done this, another bar will appear below the black HOME bar, and you will find a small plus sign to add a tile or cell. When the CREATE TILE window appears you will see the option to add a folder. If you create a folder you can upload an image in a similar manner to making a tile with a color setting and label. It is automatically linked to that board and will appear in your list of boards as an empty board.
